# **"Kala Aabharanam" Product Requirements Document (PRD) \- v2.1**

## **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

* **Primary Business Goal:** To establish "Kala Aabharanam" as the premier online destination for high-quality, culturally-rich artificial jewellery and Kalamkari textiles, capturing a significant share of the local market within the first 24 months.  
* **User Experience Goal:** To deliver a seamless, intuitive, and luxurious online shopping experience that mirrors the quality and elegance of the products, fostering user trust and encouraging repeat business.  
* **Customization Goal:** To differentiate the brand by offering robust and easy-to-use customization options for key products, establishing a unique selling proposition in a competitive market.  
* **Community Goal:** To build a loyal customer base by fostering a community around the brand through engaging content, transparent reviews, and exceptional customer support.  
* **Technical Goal:** To build a scalable, secure, and high-performance e-commerce platform on Shopify that is easy to manage and maintain.

### **Background Context**

The target demographic of young women (18-50+) is digitally savvy and seeks authenticity and personalization. They are often faced with a fragmented market of inconsistent quality and poor user experiences. "Kala Aabharanam" (Art of Jewellery) will address this by providing a curated, high-end boutique experience. The platform will not just be a transactional storefront but a destination for discovering unique designs, understanding the cultural significance of Kalamkari, and finding pieces that can be personalized. By leveraging Shopify's robust infrastructure, we can focus on brand building, product quality, and customer experience, while ensuring the underlying technology is secure, scalable, and reliable.

## **User Interface Design Goals**

### **Overall UX Vision**

The experience should feel like stepping into an exclusive, high-end boutique. It must be elegant, uncluttered, and sophisticated. The user should feel a sense of discovery and delight, with a clear focus on the craftsmanship of the products. The cultural aspect should be woven in subtly through design elements and storytelling, not just text.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Micro-interactions:** Subtle animations on button clicks, hover effects, and page transitions to enhance the feeling of quality.  
* **Visual Storytelling:** Use of high-quality imagery and thoughtful layout to tell the story behind the products.  
* **Frictionless Navigation:** A clear and logical information architecture that allows users to find what they are looking for with minimal effort.

### **Core Screens and Views**

* Homepage  
* Product Listing Page (PLP) / Collection Page  
* Product Detail Page (PDP)  
* Shopping Cart (as a slide-out drawer for quick access)  
* Checkout Page  
* User Account (Dashboard, Orders, Addresses)  
* Gallery/Lookbook  
* Blog (Listing and Detail pages)  
* FAQ  
* About Us  
* Contact Us

### **Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA**

The website must be designed and developed to be accessible to users with disabilities, including those who use screen readers or rely on keyboard navigation.

### **Branding**

The branding will be provided in a separate guide. It will emphasize elegance, tradition, and a minimalist aesthetic.

### **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

The website will be designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a perfect experience on smaller screens, and then scaled up for tablet and desktop.

## **MVP Scope Definition**

### **Out of Scope for MVP**

To ensure a focused and timely launch, the following features will be considered for future releases but are **not** part of the initial MVP:

* International shipping and multi-currency support.  
* A customer loyalty or rewards program.  
* Advanced personalization features (e.g., AI-based recommendations).  
* Integration with third-party marketplaces.

### **MVP Validation Approach**

The success of the MVP will be validated against the primary business and user experience goals. We will track the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the first 3 months post-launch:

* **Conversion Rate:** Achieve a target of 1.5% or higher.  
* **Customer Account Creation:** Target 200 new customer accounts.  
* **Newsletter Subscriptions:** Target 500 new subscribers.  
* **Average Session Duration:** Target of 2 minutes or more, indicating user engagement.  
* **Customer Feedback:** Monitor chat and contact form inquiries for recurring issues or positive feedback.

## **Technical Assumptions**

### **Repository Structure: Monorepo**

A single Git repository will be used to manage the Shopify theme code.

### **Service Architecture**

The architecture is platform-centric (Shopify). All core e-commerce logic (products, cart, checkout, payments) will be handled by Shopify's backend. Custom functionalities will be built within the Shopify theme or through the integration of trusted third-party Shopify Apps.

### **Technical Decision Framework**

While Shopify is the core platform, technical decisions for theme development and app integration will be guided by the following principles:

1. **Performance First:** Any new app, custom script, or library must be evaluated for its impact on site speed (Core Web Vitals). Lightweight solutions (e.g., Alpine.js over React for simple interactivity) are preferred.  
2. **Simplicity & Maintainability:** Solutions should be as simple as possible to implement and maintain. Prefer Shopify's native features over complex custom solutions.  
3. **App Curation:** Third-party apps will be chosen based on: high user ratings (\>4.5 stars), positive recent reviews, excellent support, and clear documentation. A maximum of 10-12 apps will be used to avoid performance degradation.  
4. **Future-Proofing:** All custom code will follow Shopify's Online Store 2.0 architecture, using modular JSON templates and sections to ensure compatibility with future theme updates.

### **Testing Requirements**

A comprehensive manual testing plan will be executed, covering all user flows, functionalities, and responsive layouts across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (iOS, Android).
